Growing on a tree 5–15 meters (16–50 feet) in height, the fruit is 15–25 cm (6–10 in) in diameter with a usual weight of 1–2 kilograms (2–4 pounds) and has a thicker rind than a grapefruit. It is divided into 11 to 18 segments and its flesh tastes like a mild grapefruit, with little of its common bitterness. The fruit generally contains few, relatively large seeds, but some varieties have numerous seeds.')\n","for ent in doc2.ents:\n","    print(ent.text)\n","    print(ent.label_)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":33,"metadata":{"editable":false,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-06-06T08:26:53.375456Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-06-06T08:26:53.375997Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-06-06T08:26:53.375783Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-06-06T08:26:53.375745Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# dictionary to hold our evaluation data\n","food_evaluation = {\n","    \"one_food\": {\n","        \"correct\": 0,\n","        \"total\": 0,\n","    },\n","    \"two_foods\": {\n","        \"correct\": 0,\n","        \"total\": 0\n","    },\n","    \"three_foods\": {\n","        \"correct\": 0,\n","        \"total\": 0\n","    }\n","  \n","}\n","\n","word_evaluation = {\n","    \"1_worded_foods\": {\n","        \"correct\": 0,\n","        \"total\": 0\n","    },\n","    \"2_worded_foods\": {\n","        \"correct\": 0,\n","        \"total\": 0\n","    },\n","    \"3_worded_foods\": {\n","        \"correct\": 0,\n","        \"total\": 0\n","    }\n","   \n","}\n","\n","# loop over data from our test food set (3 keys in total)\n","for key in TEST_FOOD_DATA:\n","    foods = TEST_FOOD_DATA[key]\n","\n","    for food in foods:\n","        #
